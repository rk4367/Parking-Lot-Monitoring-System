## Troubleshooting Static File Issues

- Always run the app using `python app.py` and access it via `http://localhost:5000`.
- Do NOT open HTML files directly in your browser; static files will not load.
- If CSS or JS is not loading, open your browser's developer tools (F12), go to the Network tab, and look for 404 errors for `.css` or `.js` files.
- If you see 404s, ensure the `static/` folder exists and contains the correct files.
- If running in production (e.g., with gunicorn or nginx), ensure your server is configured to serve the `static/` directory.
- You can test static file serving by visiting `/static-test` in your browser.
